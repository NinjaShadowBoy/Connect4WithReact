A classic Connect 4 game built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. Play against a friend and see who can connect four discs first! The game automatically restarts when a player wins or the board is full.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Win Detection & Auto-Restart**: Automatically detects when a player wins or the game ends in a draw, and restarts the game.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed for better code quality and maintainability.

## How to Play

1. Players take turns dropping colored discs into an **8x8 grid**.
2. The first player to connect **four discs** horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
3. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
4. The game automatically restarts after a win or a draw.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript for better development.
